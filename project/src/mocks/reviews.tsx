        Discerning travellers and Wes Anderson fans will luxuriate in the glorious
        Mittel-European kitsch of one of the director&apos;s funniest and most exquisitely designed films in years.

        Anderson&apos;s films are too precious for some, but for those of us willing to lose
        ourselves in them, they&apos;re a delight. &apos;The Grand Budapest Hotel&apos; is no different, except that he has added
        a hint of gravitas to the mix, improving the recipe.

        I didn&apos;t find it amusing, and while I can appreciate the creativity, it&apos;s an
        hour and 40 minutes I wish I could take back.

        The mannered, madcap proceedings are often delightful, occasionally silly, and
        here and there, gruesome and/or heartbreaking.

        It is certainly a magical and childlike way of storytelling, even if the content
        is a little more adult.
